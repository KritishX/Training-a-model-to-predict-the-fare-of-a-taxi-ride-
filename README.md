Taxi Fare Prediction with Machine Learning
This project trains a regression model to predict the fare of a New York City taxi ride based on pickup/dropoff coordinates, date & time, and passenger count. Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and various data visualization tools.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Seaborn, Plotly

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit-learn

ðŸ“Š Workflow Summary
Cleaned and preprocessed the data

Engineered features like distance and ride time

Normalized inputs and trained a neural network

Evaluated model using MAE and RMSE

Visualized predicted vs. actual fare amounts
